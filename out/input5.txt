Reports suggest that Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) is preparing funding for orders from both Airbus And Boeing, for around 70 aircraft! But are they actually new?

The pandemic has not been good for aircraft orders. Both major aircraft manufacturers would welcome any order in these times. And at the same time, they are fighting for the orders they already have. And try to turn any would-be cancellations, into deferrals. We have seen that Airbus recently ended long-standing negotiations with its suppliers, because they could not sustain a low rate of production in the long term. So, news of an order from Saudia, of such a size, would be vital, for them or Boeing.

Saudia – Orders For 70 New Airbus And Boeing Aircraft?

The report suggests that Saudia is raising 11.5 billion riyals ($3.07 billion) to help finance a new order. The airline will add more A321neo aircraft to its existing orders. They will also add Boeing 777s and 787s. The news comes from a banker, speaking to local news. Saudia is raising these funds in part through banks.

ORDERS SUPPORTING SAUDIA’S STILL-YOUNG CURRENT FLEET?
At the moment, Saudia has a fleet of 146 aircraft, not including its cargo fleet. They already have 18 787-9 and 787-10 aircraft, with five more orders for the latter. The rest of Saudia’s existing orders consist of aircraft from the A320neo family. These are 30 A320neos, 5 A321neos, 15 A321LRs and another 15 A321XLRs. So along with the Dreamliners, existing orders add up to 70. They have options for 35 more Airbus aircraft.

Like most, the airline has suffered in the pandemic. The owner of the airline is the Saudi government. And they have had to inject at least $7 billion of support to the airline. This support started in 2019, before the pandemic, as the airline was already struggling. Saudia’s existing orders for 65 narrowbodies will replace 62 A320/A321ceos.

However it is not clear if this leak has to do with Saudia’s existing order, or an additional one. More single-aisle jets would add capacity in the airline’s short/medium haul fleet. In the long-haul side, Saudia have 32 A330-300 aircraft. But these aircraft are not old! The average age of Saudia’s A330s is just over 6 years.

The news also mentions orders for new Boeing 777s for Saudia. Obviously we don’t know if this is for 777s (cargo?), or the 777X. They don’t yet have any orders for the latter. However they do have 39 777-300ERs, with an average age of under 6 years. Going back to single-aisles, their A320-200s are the same age. The A321-200s are a bit older, at just over 9 years.

Time will tell. Either this is a new order for Saudia, or it is their way of continuing to fund an order, in turbulent times.

An angry cat forced the crew of a Boeing 737 to return to their departure airport, when it started attacking the two pilots after take off!

The incident happened last week, on the 24th of February. It was an evening flight from Khartoum International Airport (HSSS) in Sudan, to Doha (OTHH), Qatar. The aircraft was a Tarco Aviation Boeing 737. The crew entered the Boeing the 737 and boarded the passengers normally, without a cat appearing on the roster! The flight took off and was going just fine for around half an hour. And then suddenly, it wasn’t fine at all.

The frightened cat jumped out of its hiding place in the cockpit of the Boeing 737 and started to attack the astonished pilots. Frightened cats generally want to be left alone, having enough distance from others. There are many possible ways one could use, to describe the size of a 737 cockpit. “Spacious” isn’t one of them. Calming down a feline invader while they were in their seats is not something pilots generally train for!



DEALING WITH A ROGUE CAT IN A BOEING 737
The crew elected to return immediately to Khartoum. The crew informed the passengers of the return. We don’t know if the passengers learned about the cat in the Boeing 737 cockpit! In any case, the aircraft returned and landed without further incident. All that remained then, was to figure out how on earth this stowaway made it on board!

There have been incidents where pets escaped passengers’ control, and made it to the cockpit. But such incidents are quite rare these days, because of the locked cockpits. No, this particular cat was prudent enough to enter the Boeing 737’s cockpit the night before! Local information indicates that the aircraft had spent the night before in a hangar, while engineering was working on it. The company believes that the cat made it on board, while crews were either working on the plane, or cleaning it.

But in the grand scheme of things, the cat was lucky. We recently wrote about another cat, in another Boeing 737 cockpit, in Israel. That one also managed to make it on board, while engineers entered the aircraft. However this jet was sitting out in the desert. Their job done, the engineers then left the plane, locking the cat inside. We don’t know how long that invader spent in there, but it was long enough for it to eat through part of the shroud above the panel!



Hopefully, the cat managed to fare OK after exiting the Tarco Aviation Boeing 737. Those on it that actually had tickets to Doha, departed a bit later.
